# Project: Recipes 

This repository is my solution to the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) assignment for building web pages. The project requires building a small website where three selected recipes are presented (both graphically and textually). This README.md file is part of the assignment. 
<br> 
The recipes I decided to present are the following: 
* pizza 
* lasagne 
* mushroom risotto 


The project will gradually develop to accommodate the new skills learned during the course. The levels are the following: 
<br> 
1. HTML basics 
2. CSS basics 
3. JS basics

At the moment, the project is presented for the following level: `CSS basics`.
